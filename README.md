**Vulnerabilities in LLM code generation**

We will generate a full website with Claude Sonnet and test it for web exploits and vulnerabilities. We will do this in steps, adding a new component at a time. Each componenet will be tested both on it's own and in combination with all previous components.

We first as Claude to generate a simple website to start with...

Upon first inspection, as well as running the code through a model trained specifically for the purpose of cybersecurity, "Arcanum" https://chatgpt.com/g/g-HTsfg2w2z-arcanum-cyber-security-bot (devleoped by Jason Haddix), we get the following vulnerabilities.

- Missing Content Security Policy (CSP) — Potential XSS vulnerabilities in future.
- Missing security headers — Headers like X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, and - Strict-Transport-Security should be implemented.
- Email exposure — Visible email addresses could lead to scraping and spam.
- Lack of HTTPS — Without HTTPS, the site is vulnerable to MITM attacks.
- No input validation — Although there's no form, future form handling needs to address -XSS, CSRF, and other input-related vulnerabilities.
- Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) — If sections like "Events" are made dynamic, -ensure proper access control is enforced.

Very good. At this point, let's move the CSS out of the HTML. Show me the file heirarcy as
